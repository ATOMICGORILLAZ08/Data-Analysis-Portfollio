Analysys of the relationship between the rise of a chain fountain's peak and intitial drop height. Velocity and conservation of momentum were also explored.
R Studio Cloud was used to conduct data analysis and presentation.


The "Chain Fountain plots .r" file contains the R scripts used to create plots for analysis.


The "Chain Fountain.rmd" file contains R markdown information. R markdown is Knit to PDF because Latex was used to create two of the tables for analysis. 
If the file is Knit to HTML or Word, all information in the R markdown will appear, but the two tables mentioned above will not be visible.

The "Chain-Fountain.pdf" file is a visual representation of the "Chain Fountain.rmd" file after Knit to PDF is initiated in R Markdown.

The remaining files included are either data for analysis or images to illustrate data gathering and background information.
